VG Downloader is a lightweight CLI that lets you download (almost) any video game album. It is built with PromptUI and pings downloads.khinsider.com to retrieve the album for download. It uses work channels and work groups to concurrently get the download links and download them at the same time. This significantly reduces the amount of time to download the album vs. sequentially downloading from the website.
